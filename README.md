# Bresenhamâ€™s Circle Algorithm in Java

This Java program demonstrates the implementation of Bresenham's Circle Drawing Algorithm using the `Graphics` class in the `javax.swing` library. The program draws multiple circles with different radii on a window using an efficient algorithm for rasterizing a circle.

## Features
- Draws concentric circles with radii ranging from 100 to 200 pixels.
- Implements Bresenham's Circle Drawing Algorithm for efficient circle plotting.
